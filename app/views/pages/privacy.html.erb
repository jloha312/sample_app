<h2>Grademypitch Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Updated March 12, 2012</h3>


<p>This privacy policy explains how Grademypitch collects, uses, transfers or otherwise handles  personally identifiable information from you, a visitor to the Grademypitch website (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”).
</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>This privacy policy only covers data collected through the Site. This privacy policy does not cover any other data collection or processing practices, including, without limitation, the practices of other web pages to which we link. When we refer to this privacy policy in notices and consent requests related to feedback requests (i.e. grading a pitch), special-purpose web pages or otherwise, this privacy policy applies as modified in the particular notice or consent request (e.g.,  with respect to types of data collected or purposes of collection).</p>

<h3>Types of Data and Collection Methods</h3>
<p>Through the Site, we collect data that you actively submit (“<strong>Actively Submitted Data</strong>”) as well as  data that we collect about you from other sources (“<strong>Passively Tracked Data</strong>”):
</p>
<p><em>Actively Submitted Data:</em> When you request information, subscribe to a mailing list or for a service, register as a user, post to one of our forums or communities, request or respond to a request for feedback or otherwise actively send us data, we usually collect data such as your name, email address(es), telephone number(s), country of residency, and certain information related to the business you represent (if any). In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., credit card number and related verification information). When you use our tools to ask for feedback, you decide who to ask. In each such instance, however, you will know what data we collect through the Site, because you have asked your feedback respondents to actively submit it.
</p>
<p><em>Passively Tracked Data: </em>When you visit the Site, we also passively track information on your computer and  Internet connection, such as the IP address of your computer and/or Internet service provider, the date and time you access the Site, the Internet address of web sites from which you link to or arrive at the Site, the computer technology you are using and your movements and preferences on our Site. We use  technology that many other web sites employ, including, without limitation, "cookies" or small data files stored on your computer's hard drive, to collect information such as the aforementioned. In some instances, we also use cookies to collect information in connection with future visits from that web site, to recognize you as a previous visitor and to track your activity at our Site. You do not need to have cookies turned on to participate in feedback or to visit our Site. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser, but please note that this may adversely affect your user experience and convenience.</p>
<p><em>Combinations:</em> Unless you also actively submit personal information such as your name or address in connection with Passively Tracked Data, Passively Tracked Data does not typically allow us to identify you personally.&#160; (Even though it theoretically could be done, we do not try to find out who you are, unless we  need to comply with a legal obligation.) &#160;To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to combine Passively Tracked Data or data available via a third party with personal data that you choose to actively submit. Specifically if you provide feedback via Grademypitch we will "fingerprint" your system in order to combat fraud. In generating this "fingerprint" we gather only publicly available information from your browser; this includes your IP address, browser version, and other similar types of information.</p>
<h3>Collection Purposes, Use of Data</h3>
<p><em>Passively Tracked Data: </em>We collect Passively Tracked Data primarily for purposes of administering, protecting and improving our Site and our systems, to better understand the preferences of our Site visitors, to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage, and to help personalize your experience on our Site. We also use cookies and Passively Tracked Data to protect the integrity of feedback, e.g., to prevent feedback respondents from grading the same user or pitch twice within a short time frame.</p>

<p><em>Actively Submitted Data:</em> We collect Actively Submitted Data primarily for two purposes:  Firstly, for the purpose for which you originally sent us the data e.g., to receive the service you requested, to confirm your registration for a service, to allow you to gather feedback, to bill you for services or to send you information or materials that you requested. Secondly, for the purposes of informing you about our products and services; additionally, you can opt out of receiving marketing emails as explained below.</p>
<h3>Disclosures of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We are not in the business of selling or renting your information to telemarketers and do not share your personally identifiable information with others, except as follows:</p>
<ul class="greenUl">
<li class="greenLi">We may share your information with affiliated companies for reward redemption and/or other market research opportunities.</li>
<li class="greenLi">If you use any of our services with a corporate email account  (i.e., an account for employees, contractors, etc. as opposed to a personal email account with a general email service provider such as AOL, Hotmail,  Yahoo, Gmail, etc.), and such corporation signs up for an enterprise account with us or is considering an enterprise account, we may inform such corporation of your use of our service, so that you can benefit from enterprise pricing and any other benefits negotiated by the corporation for its registered users or otherwise arising from such coordination.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We may share your information as required by law or in the interest of protecting or exercising our or others' legal rights, e.g., without limitation, in connection with requests from law enforcement officials and in connection with court proceedings.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We may share or transfer your information in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We reserve the right to use and disclose any information collected via the Site that is not in personally identifiable form.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We do not share, sell, rent or trade your personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Third Party Data Collection Through Our Site</h3>
<p>When one of our users deploys our tools to ask for feedback or otherwise to collect data, e.g., through grademypitch.com, such user will receive and process any responses. We will host, and compile aggregate information, such as the Overall Pitch Score. Personally identifiable information such as your name and email will only be displayed to the user who's pitch you graded. We may also view such information in connection with technical support, with the consent of the user who asked for the feedback, or in any other manner permitted by this privacy policy. We cannot control the data processing practices of our users and we do not assume any responsibility for actions of our users who collect feedback or of any other third parties.</p>
<h3>Tell A Friend</h3>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Grademypitch stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@grademypitch.com">support@grademypitch.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h3>Co-branded Sites</h3>
<p>From time to time we may partner with third parties to provide co-branded sites. &#160;In the event that you provide personally identifiable information on such a site, this privacy policy will continue to apply, unless that site has its own privacy policy. You retain full rights to  you data and may either contact us at <a href="mailto:support@grademypitch.com">support@grademypitch.com</a> to change or remove your data or  alternatively you may ask us for a contact at the third party who can provide this service.</p>
<h3>Opt-Out</h3>
<p>In connection with promotions or other projects, we may ask you specifically whether you have objections  against a certain kind of data use or sharing. If you opt-out under such circumstances, we will respect your decision. To opt-out of receiving further commercial emails, sharing of your information with our affiliates or to unsubscribe from services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@grademypitch.com">support@grademypitch.com</a>. Please note that our affiliates and other  data recipients have their own data privacy policies, which may differ from ours and you would have to contact them separately with respect to opt-out requests.</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>If personal information you have submitted through the Site is no longer accurate, current, or complete, and you wish to update it, or you wish to delete it, please update your profile on the Site (e.g. <a href="http://www.grademypitch.com/" target="_blank">www.grademypitch.com</a>).</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
